## Who am I
Designer by education,

Developer by interest,

Tinkerer by curiosity.

---

I have always been captivated by the world of technology. While all my friends were playing a modified version of a game called [tibia](https://otservlist.org), I was busy creating my own (hacked) version.

This is where my interest for programming began as I had to figure out how to host a server, create a database or even change the game code to make it work as I wanted it to work.

Checkout my awesome [bomb squad mod](https://otland.net/threads/bombsquad-9-6.187509)!

The process of unraveling complex systems has become a driving force behind my pursuit of the digital domain, ever since the day I ran my first `XAMPP` stack with a `phpMyAdmin` database to host my own game server.

## Creative technologist
Throughout my journey as a creative technologist, I have honed my skills in both design and development, merging the worlds of aesthetics and functionality.

With a firm grasp on the principles of (digital) design[^1] and a deep understanding of programming[^2], I strive to bring innovative ideas to life with the [form follows function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_follows_function#:~:text=Form%20follows%20function%20is%20a,its%20intended%20function%20or%20purpose.) mantra.

[^1]: With a bachelor's degree in [Communication and Multimedia design](https://www.cmd-amsterdam.nl) and a master's degree in [Digital Design](https://www.masterdigitaldesign.com/alumni/sander-boer)
[^2]: With 15+ years of software development experience

## What I like to do
Fusing hot technology with slick design.

I love to create tools that enhance the performance of professionals or/and empower individuals.

Collaborating with people from diverse backgrounds to achieve a shared objective is a value I hold dear. I firmly believe that exceptional solutions emerge only when we embrace a multitude of perspectives.

While I'm deeply rooted in the realm of technology, my true strengths shine at the intersection of development and User Experience (UX) design. Engaging in both disciplines is where I like to play ball.

## Who is sander _really_
Besides solving wicked problems with code, I enjoy cooking --and eating--. Making a mean pasta or some sloppy tacos, but whenever there is flavour, I'm in!

I like (to be in) nature and am your go-to-guy to entertain/annoy the dog/cat at any party!

I try to experiment with random technologies like 3d printing, Augmented- and Virtual-Reality and micro-controllers. Stepping away from that screen and interact with the (real) world.

**Sharing === caring**

I like to share my knowledge and experience with others. I do this by _giving workshops_, _mentoring students_ and trying to be _an active member of the developer community_.

You can always challenge me for a game but be aware...

I am in it to win it.

And if the sun is out, I'd love to join you for a beer (or tequila).
