## Problem
First-year CMD students are struggling to find good team dynamics and teachers don’t always have proper insight into these dynamics. “Slacking” students are hard to identify in order to support them better in their foundation year.

## Challenge
How can an online platform positively stimulate cooperation and participation among propaedeutic students by making individual performance within the project group clear and discussable?

## Outcome
Create an open platform where students and teachers can get clear but anonymous insights into team dynamics and performance over the track of their foundation year.

## Feedback
Giving- or asking for feedback can be a tough task, especially for first-year students in new teams. Even though teachers are having weekly meetings with student teams frustrations mostly come at the end of the projects. Sometimes even as late as after receiving the grade of the project.

## A contract
With Athena students of a project team are creating a contract at the start of the project with each other. This contract contains all indicators on which the students will give each other feedback upon.

The indicators are divided into 4 competences; Attitude, accountability, knowledge development and functioning within the group.

Project coordinators can set initial indicators which the students can select for their contract. Besides, Athena also allows each team to make their own indicators on which they think the whole team should act upon.

All students within a project team give weekly feedback to each other on the agreed upon indicators.

## Anonymous
As the purpose of Athena is to give more insight into team dynamics Athena is built to make sure students are giving honest feedback. Therefore, all feedback given within Athena is anonymized for both students and teachers. Athena only shows the outcome of the feedback per student but will never show who gave what feedback.

## Performance
Besides feedback as an indicator in team dynamics performance and division of tasks are sometimes hard to see for project groups and teachers alike.

Some teachers of CMD are using a scrum like approach with their project teams in order to follow the progress of a project. Athena has the option to connect any project group to a trello board if a teacher would like to.
