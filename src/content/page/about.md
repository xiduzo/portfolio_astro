_Who am I_
<span>
    Designer by education, developer by interest, tinkerer by curiosity.<br aria-hidden="true"/></br>
    I have always been captivated by the world of technology. While all my friends were playing a modified version of a game called <a href="https://otservlist.org" target="_blank">tibia</a>, my focus was on the intricacies of creating my own version.
    <br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>
    This is where my interest for programming arose as I had to figure out how to host a server, create a database or even change the game code to make it work as I wanted it to work.

    <br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>
    The process of unraveling complex systems has become a driving force behind my pursuit of the digital domain, ever since the day I first wrote the classic `hello world` program.

_Creative technologist_
<span>
    Throughout my journey as a creative technologist, I have honed my skills in both design and development, merging the worlds of aesthetics and functionality.
    <br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>
    With a firm grasp on the principles of (digital) design<sup class="text-sm">\*</sup> and a deep understanding of programming<sup class="text-sm">\*\*</sup>, I strive to bring innovative ideas to life that embodies the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_follows_function#:~:text=Form%20follows%20function%20is%20a,its%20intended%20function%20or%20purpose." target="_blank">form follows function</a> mantra.

            With a bachelor's degree in <a href="https://www.cmd-amsterdam.nl" target="_blank">Communication and Multimedia design</a> and a master's degree in <a href="https://www.masterdigitaldesign.com/alumni/sander-boer" target="_blank">Digital Design</a>

_What I like to do_
Fusing amazing technology with good design. My driving force is to create tools that enhance the performance of professionals and empower individuals, pushing me to go the extra mile.
<br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>
Collaborating with individuals from diverse backgrounds to achieve a shared objective is a value I hold dear. I firmly believe that exceptional solutions emerge when we embrace a multitude of perspectives.
<br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>
While I'm deeply rooted in the realm of technology, my true strengths shine at the intersection of UX and development. Actively engaging in both disciplines is where I like to play ball.

## Who is sander _really_
Next to coding, I enjoy to cook and eat. I am fan of the Italian and Mexican kitchen but whenever there is flavour, I'm in!
<br aria-hidden="true"/><br aria-hidden="true"/>
I like (to be in) nature and am your go-to-guy to entertain/annoy the dog/cat at any party!

From time to time I try to experiment with random technologies like 3d printing, Augmented- and Virtual-Reality and micro-controllers.

Sharing = caring.

You can always challenge me for a game but be aware, I am in it to win it.

If the sun is out, I'd love to join you for a beer (or tequila).
