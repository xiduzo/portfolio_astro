_Who am I_
<span>
Designer by education, developer by interest, tinkerer by curiosity.<br/></br>
I have always been captivated by the world of technology. While all my friends were playing a modified version of a game called <a href="https://otservlist.org" target="_blank">tibia</a>, my focus was on the intricacies of creating my own version.<br/><br/>
This is where my interest for programming arose as I had to figure out how to host a server, create a database or even change the game code to make it work as I wanted it to work.<br/><br/>
The process of unraveling complex systems has become a driving force behind my pursuit of the digital domain, ever since the day I first wrote the classic <code>hello world</code> program.

_Creative technologist_
<span>
Throughout my journey as a creative technologist, I have honed my skills in both design and development, merging the worlds of aesthetics and functionality.<br/><br/>
With a firm grasp on the principles of (digital) design<sup class="text-sm">\*</sup> and a deep understanding of programming<sup class="text-sm">\*\*</sup>, I strive to bring innovative ideas to life that embodies the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_follows_function#:~:text=Form%20follows%20function%20is%20a,its%20intended%20function%20or%20purpose." target="_blank">form follows function</a> mantra.<br/><br/>
<span class="text-sm">
<sup>\*</sup> <em>With a bachelor's degree in <a href="https://www.cmd-amsterdam.nl" target="_blank">Communication and Multimedia design</a> and a master's degree in <a href="https://www.masterdigitaldesign.com" target="_blank">Digital Design</a> </em><br/><br/>
<sup>\*\*</sup> <em>With 15+ years of software development experience</em><br/><br/>
</span>
</span>

_What I like to do_
<span>
Fusing amazing technology with good design. My driving force is to create tools that enhance the performance of professionals and empower individuals, pushing me to go the extra mile.<br/><br/>
Collaborating with individuals from diverse backgrounds to achieve a shared objective is a value I hold dear. I firmly believe that exceptional solutions emerge when we embrace a multitude of perspectives.<br/><br/>
While my focus predominantly lies in the realm of technology, my true strengths lie in the intersection of UX and development. I recognize the value of actively participating in both disciplines, allowing me to enhance my strengths of both.
